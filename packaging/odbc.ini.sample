### All-in one way to specify connection with [optional] settings:
# Url = https://default:password@localhost:8443/query?database=default
#
# ...or minimal (will connect to port 8443 if protocol is "https://" or 8123 if it is "http://"):
# Url = https://localhost
#
# Otherwise you can set the Server, Database, UID, PWD, Port and Proto parameters.
#
# Possible parameters with default values:
#
# Url =                         # URL that points to a running ClickHouse instance, may include username, password, port, database, etc.
# Proto =                       # One of: http, https. When empty it is deduced from Url, or from Port and SSLMode: https if 443 or 8443 or SSLMode is not empty, http otherwise.
# Server =                      # IP or hostname of a server with a running ClickHouse instance on it. When empty it is deduced from URL.
# Host =                        # Alias for Server.
# Port =                        # Port on which the ClickHouse instance is listening. When empty it is deduced from Url, or from Proto: 8443 if https, 8123 otherwise.
# Path = /query                 # The URL path.
# Username = default
# UID =                         # Alias for Username.
# Password =
# PWD =                         # Alias for Password.
# Database = default            # Database name.
# Timeout = 30                  # Connection timeout in seconds.
# VerifyConnectionEarly = off   # Verify the connection and credentials during SQLConnect and similar calls, otherwise it is done when querying the data.
# SSLMode =                     # Certificate verification method (for TLS/SSL connections, ignored in Windows), use `allow` to ignore self-signed and bad certificates.
#                               # Other values, including empty, enable strict verification
# PrivateKeyFile =              # Path to private key file (for TLS/SSL connections, ignored in Windows)
# CertificateFile =             # Path to certificate file (for TLS/SSL connections, ignored in Windows)
# CALocation =                  # Path to the file or directory containing the CA/root certificates (used by TLS/SSL connections, ignored in Windows)
# HugeIntAsString =             # Report integer column types that may underflow or overflow 64-bit signed integer (SQL_BIGINT) as a String/SQL_VARCHAR
# DriverLog = off               # Enable or disable the extended driver logging (enabled by default for Debug builds)
# DriverLogFile = \temp\clickhouse-odbc-driver.log # or /tmp/clickhouse-odbc-driver.log on Linux and macOS.
#                               # Path to the extended driver log file
# AutoSessionId = off           # Auto generate session_id required to use some features of CH (e.g. TEMPORARY TABLE)
# ClientName =                  # Sets additional information about the calling application. This string will be used as a prefix for the User-Agent header.
# Compress = off                # Pass enable_http_compression=1 parameter to server
